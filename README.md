Networking of Nodes - Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository explores various Data Structures and Algorithms involving Networking of Nodes. The focus is on graph traversal, shortest paths, tree structures, dynamic connectivity, and optimization problems where nodes are interconnected.

Key Concepts and Features:
Graph Representation: Implementing graphs using adjacency lists and matrices.
Graph Traversal: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), cycle detection, and topological sorting.
Shortest Path Algorithms: Dijkstraâ€™s, Bellman-Ford, and Floyd-Warshall for efficient path finding.
Tree Structures: Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), AVL Trees, and their operations.
Dynamic Connectivity: Union-Find (Disjoint Set) for handling dynamic connectivity queries.
Network Flow Problems: Solving Max Flow, Minimum Cut, and Network Optimization Problems.
Real-World Applications:
Social networks
Recommendation systems
Traffic management
Distributed databases
Usage:
